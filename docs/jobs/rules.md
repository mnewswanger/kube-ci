# Rules #

Rules are configured to determine whether or not a job should be triggered.

Rules are triggered based on `labels`.

## Applying Rules ##

Rules can be applied via the following methods:

* `exact` - Provided string matches the label
* `exists` - Passes if the provided label exists
* `regex` - Provided regular expression matches the label

Each rule also supports inversion.

Mutliple rules can be combined in both AND / OR combinations.  Rules can be applied to `jobs`, `steps`, and `tasks`.
